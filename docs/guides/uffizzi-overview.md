# Uffizzi overview  

Uffizzi is an open engine for previewing full-stack applications in the cloud. Uffizzi automates the creation of on-demand test environments when you open pull requests (PRs) or build new images. Each preview gets a secure URL that's continually updated when you push new commits or image tags, so teams can provide feedback on new features or bug fixes before merging. This capability, known as [Continuous Previews](../continuous-previews.md), helps alleviate two problems that commonly plague software development teams:  

1. **Dirty code in your `main` branch**: Uffizzi provides Dev and QA teams with the ability to rapidly share and review new features before they're mergedâ€”catching bugs early and keeping them out of a team's main git branch. This capability also empowers a team to separate functional testing from integration testing, since an individual developer's topic branch can be tested in isolation before merging it with the rest of the team's contributions.

2. **Broken QA environment**: Uffizzi eliminates problems associated with multiple developers sharing a single test environment. With Uffizzi, previews are isolated (one developer's preview won't clobber another's) and ephemeral (they exist only as long as they are needed). New previews can be triggered when important events occur, like when a new PR is opened or a new image tag is created. Then previews environemnts are destroyed when the PR is closed or a tag is updated.

## The Uffizzi platform   

Uffizzi supports deploying previews directly from your [git repository](../guides/git-integrations.md) or from a [container registry](../guides/container-registry-integrations.md), so you can let Uffizzi build your application or you can bring your own build (BYOB) system. In fact, you can use Uffizzi to [augment your existing CI/CD solution with a Continuous Previews (CP) capability](../engineeringblog/ci-cd-registry.md). 

Uffizzi supports *configuration-as-code*. This means to configure Uffizzi, you simply provide a `docker-compose.uffizzi.yml` file that describes your application stack in Docker Compose syntax, along with a few extra parameters to tell Uffizzi when and how to deploy your previews. See the [Uffizzi Compose file reference](../references/compose-spec.md) for details or check out these [example Uffizzi Compose files](../references/example-compose.md).

When Continuous Previews are configured, Uffizzi uses webhooks on your git repository or container registry to watch for changes to your application. When it detects a change, a new preview is deployed based on the policies you set within your Uffizzi Compose file. For each new preview, Uffizzi generates a secure, shareable URL, and when you push new commits/tag updates, the preview link is automatically updated. This allows you to avoid context switching by staying within a git workflow - you never have to tell Uffizzi to deploy previews...It just works!

## What can I use Uffizzi for?  

- **Implementing a Continuous Previews capability**  
If you're new to this concept, checkout this [Continuous Previews overview](../guides/continuous-previews.md).  

- **Catch mistakes early**  
It's much easier to find and fix issues early in the development cycle than after an issue has been merged. Merge with confidence knowing a feature works as intended.  

- **Iterate quickly**  
Uffizzi helps improve collaboration across Dev and Product Teams to iterate faster.  

- **Accelerate release cycles**  
Uffizzi has been shown to increase development velocity by reducing returned tickets.  

- **Deconflict your shared Test/QA environment**  
You can eliminate the bottlenecks of a shared development environment since every developer on your team can have as many preview environments as they need. And because preview environments are isolated and ephemeral, you no longer have to worry that a new commit might break QA for the rest of the team. 

- **Trace root cause more easily**  
With Uffizzi, teams can test topic branches *before* they're merged. This means you can separate functional testing from integration testing, allowing you to merge with confidence knowing that the feature works as expected before it undergoes integration testing.  

- **Reduce cost**  
Uffizzi's preview environments can replace your static QA environment. Every preview exists in its own lightweight environment, which is destroyed when a PR is closed or after a certain number of hours. See [Uffizzi Compose file reference](references/compose-spec.md) for configuration options.

- **Augment your existing CI/CD pipeline**  
Continuous Previews can be combined with your existing CI/CD solution
