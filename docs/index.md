# Overview

Previewing code before it’s merged shouldn’t be limited to frontends. Define your full-stack apps with a familiar syntax based on Docker Compose, then Uffizzi will create on-demand test environments when you open pull requests or build new images. Preview URLs are updated when there’s a new commit, so your team can catch mistakes early, iterate quickly, and accelerate your release cycles.
