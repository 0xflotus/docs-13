# Secrets  

Secrets provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across all Previews in a project. The environment variables are defined as name/value pairs and are injected at runtime. 

Secrets can be added in the Uffizzi Dashboard (**Project** > **Project Settings** > **Secrets**). Once added, they cannot be viewed or edited. To update a Secret, you should delete the old Secret and create a new one.
