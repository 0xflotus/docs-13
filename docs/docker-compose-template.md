# Create a Docker Compose template

Uffizzi is designed to be developer-friendly, so it uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) as its configuration format.

!!! note
    Uffizzi supports a subset of the full [Compose specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md). For a full list of supported keywords, see the [Uffizzi Compose file reference](references/compose-spec.md).
