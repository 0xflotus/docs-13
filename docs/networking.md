Every app environment in Uffizzi includes a load balancer that receives incoming HTTPS requests and routes those requests to the HTTP port specified for the container which receives incoming requests. Uffizzi load balancers are set up and managed automatically, so you don't need to enable or configure them. Uffizzi also handles HTTPS certificates for you; our certificate authority is trusted by all popular web browsers and devices. All of a deployment's containers belong to the same Kubernetes Pod, so they can talk to each other at 127.0.0.1 (i.e., localhost).

Separate preview deployments do not share an internal network, so they may only communicate over the public internet.
